# sjs

Safe JavaScript


## TODO

- [ ] find a new name!
- [ ] in inferred types, preserve source code context info and use it for more readable unification errors
- [ ] handle funcs with no return statement (should be same as return;)
- [ ] allow defining constructor-object properties using the notation `obj.prototype.something = ...`
- [ ] support all ES3 statement types (or reject them, but handle all)


### Future

- [ ] type annotations
- [ ] add support for CommonJS modules
