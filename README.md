Safe JavaScript

## TODO

- [ ] add "module" primitive that allows vardecls, use it to map ES3 Scripts (should cause trivial.js to pass)
- [ ] support all ES3 statement (or reject them, but handle all)
- [ ] preserve source code context info and use it for errors
- [ ] support warnings
- [ ] handle funcs with no return statement (should be same as return;)
